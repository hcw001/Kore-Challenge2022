# Kore-Challenge2022
Submission code for 2022 Kore challenge on Kaggle
I worked on this June to July 2022. 
It broke the top 100 on the rankings but other commitments prevented me from spending the time to further improve upon it.
This is the product of a dozen or so revisions and a lot of debugging.
This challenge was my introduction into the machine learning world.
My preferred language is python.

The code utilizes several Kaggle helper commands that have pre-built classes in order to interact w/ the gameboard.
The final function defined receives the board configuration and observations and returns actions for each of my shipyards.
Games last 400 turns or until one player has taken over all of the other's shipyards.
